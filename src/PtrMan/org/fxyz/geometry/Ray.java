    /*==========================================================================
    
        TO DO: Consider adding Intersection methods for:
    
            ~ node.boundsInParent
                *with check for meshView
    
            ~ TriangleMesh triangles. 
                *performance can potentially be increased by implementing a 
                 BVT (bounding volume tree), or an OctTree hierarchy 
                 possibly reducing the number of triangle intersection checks.
